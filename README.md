## Introduction

In today's fast-paced world, busy schedules and lack of knowledge about healthy eating habits have caused a significant percentage of the population to neglect their health. 

This trend is even more concerning when it comes to children, who are spending more and more time indoors, playing video games and snacking on unhealthy foods. 

Addressing this issue by educating young children about healthy eating habits seems impossible but weâ€™ve found an interactive and engaging way to do it.

**Fit Rush** is a 2D platformer educational game, developed in Unity, that children can play alone on their tablet or phone. It's a fun and interactive way for kids to learn about nutrition, without the need for lengthy articles or boring lessons. 

## Gameplay Mechanics

Your goal is to guide the main character through different levels while making healthy food choices. You'll have control over the character's movement as they run and jump through the platformer levels. In addition to making healthy choices, you need to be quick! You have a limited amount of time to complete each level and fulfill the required standards.

## Food Consumption and Understanding

As the character runs, they will come across various food items in the game. As they consume the food, the game provides information about its nutritional value, such as protein, carbs, and fat content. This way, the player gains a better understanding of the nature of the food they are consuming. With each level, kids become more confident in their ability to identify and choose the right foods for themselves.

## Balancing Intake

However, there's a twist! Each food group has a limit, represented in the game. For instance, the character can only consume a certain amount of protein, carbs, and fat. If the player surpasses the limit, he will fail the level and has to restart it. This adds a challenge and promotes the importance of a balanced diet. Players need to make wise choices and manage their intake to maintain a healthy diet within the limits. 

## Feedback and Notifications

To support the players, the game provides real-time feedback. If the character consumes too much of a specific food group, the player will receive visual cues to indicate the need for balance. This helps reinforce healthy eating habits and prompts players to make better choices.
